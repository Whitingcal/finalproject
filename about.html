                <h3>Haley Newman</h3>
                <p>I grew up all of my life in Upstate New York, later my family and I moved to Colorado, and now I live in Rexburg Idaho. I have a degree in Therapeutic Recreation but I specialize in Equine Therapy. I grew up around horses all of my life. I would ride whenever I got the chance and I have been working with horses for years. I wanted to start this company because I wanted to give people the opportunity to learn how to ride horses for affortable prices, and also to share my passion and love for riding horses with others who want to learn to ride.</p>
